### How to Contribute

A good way to help is to test, and report bugs. ( Please wait until the application is stable enough for testing first)

Patches are preferably to be sent via a GitHub pull request. If that can't be done, contact me either on IRC, reddit or directly on GitHub and something can be figured out

Patches should be self contained. A good rule of thumb is to have one patch per separate issue, feature, or logical change. Also, no other changes, such as random whitespace changes or reindentation. Following the code style of the particular chunk of code you're modifying is encourgaged. Proper squashing should be done (eg, if you're making a buggy patch, then a later patch to fix the bug, both patches should be merged).
